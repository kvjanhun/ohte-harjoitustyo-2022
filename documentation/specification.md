Specification
===
A real-time game where a player moves through a maze to reach the goal, choosing a beneficial route, before the timer runs out. At this point, a name and theme is yet to be decided, and the basic idea explained in a general manner.

UI draft
---
Game launches with a menu screen with options to start the game, view highscores, or to exit the program.

Game area is a cell-based 10x12 maze. Player can move up, down, left or right on the screen, one cell at a time. Player aspires to reach the goal before the timer runs out, using a route that doesn't deplete player's SP (success points).

Basic functionality
---
* Player moves around the maze with `↑` `↓` `←` `→` keys, one cell at a time. 
* Game window's borders and walls can't be passed through. 
* When colliding with a power-up or power-down item, the item disappears and the SP counter is increased or decreased by one, respectively.
* If the SP counter reaches 0, game ends as a loss.
* A timer counts down seconds and if the game doesn't end before it reaches 0, game ends as a loss.
* Amount of SP and time in the beginning is a set amount for a certain level.
* Game can be paused by clicking a menu button in the header, or by pressing `ESC` key.
* If the goal is reached in time succesfully, player can enter a name to be saved into a leaderboard. These scores will be saved in a file.
* First implementation of the game will feature one, pre-determined maze, with the items always in a fixed position.

Further development
---
* More levels should be implemented, two different approaches will be considered:
  1. Levels will be hand-crafted and each level will have a pre-determined SP, time, and item positions. Levels will be independent of each other and the level will be selected from the main menu. After defeating level, player could continue directly to the next, newly unlocked level.
  2. Levels will be randomly generated by an algorithm and after it's defeated, a next one is continued into, with the SP and time remaining.
* At the moment, the approach #1 will be more likely to be implemented during the course. Later, the approach #2 could be added as an alternative game mode.
* Settings file to save selected settings:
  * Difficulty (same levels with harder starting conditions)
  * Key bindings (not all keyboards feature arrow keys)
* More items could be added, for example:
  * Pushable obstacle
  * Stronger power-ups or power-downs (±2)
  * Doors and keys
  * Teleportation
